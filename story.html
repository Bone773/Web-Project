        <h2>The story so far...</h2>
          <p> 
            A pair of twins who travel across the stars and visit different worlds arrive in Teyvat but find that Khaenri'ah is ablaze in flames. Attempting to leave the twins are separated 
            by an unknown god, who takes one and seals away the other. 500 years later the sealed twin, referred to as the "Traveler", awakens and meets Paimon. The pair travel to nearby 
            Mondstadt to start their search for their missing twin.<br><br>

            Paimon and the Traveler arrive at Mondstadt, and encounter a dragon named Stormterror which attacks the city. Aided by an unknown entity later revealed to be Venti, the Traveler 
            fends off Stormterror and is recognized by Jean, acting Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius. The Traveler helps the Knights restore order to the region, and then meets Venti, 
            who comes up with a plan to stop Stormterror, whose true name is Dvalin. Venti requests for them to retrieve a holy lyre so that he may play it to Dvalin, calming him. After 
            retrieving the lyre, which was first stolen by Fatui, Venti attempts to calm Dvalin but realizes that the Abyss Order have been manipulating him, and Venti's true identity is 
            revealed: Barbatos, the Anemo Archon. The Traveler, accompanied by Jean, Diluc and Venti, pursue Dvalin to his domain and free him from the Abyss Order's influence. Returning to 
            Mondstadt Venti is ambushed by the Fatui Harbinger La Signora, who steals his Gnosis.<br><br>
            
            The Traveler resolves to meet the other six Archons to find the god who took their sibling. Venti advises the Traveler to travel to Liyue next to meet Rex Lapis, the Geo Archon 
            during a ritual. However, during the ritual Rex Lapis is apparently killed, and the Traveler is a potential suspect. The Traveler meets Fatui Harbinger Childe who advises them to 
            find the Adepti to clear their name. To investigate the death, Childe then manipulates the Traveler to work with Zhongli, a funeral parlor consultant who is overseeing Rex Lapis' 
            funeral. While working with Zhongli, Childe discovers the location of Rex Lapis' body, which had been hidden away. The Traveler confronts Childe who attempts to take the Gnosis from 
            the body, but is unable to find it, concluding that Rex Lapis is still alive. To lure out Rex Lapis, Childe reluctantly summons Osial, an ancient god once defeated by Rex Lapis, but 
            the combined forces of the Traveler, the Liyue Qixing and the Adepti defeat it. In the aftermath the Traveler finds out Zhongli's true identity as Rex Lapis, who hands over his Gnosis 
            to La Signora as part of a discreet agreement with Tsaritsa. Zhongli explains he wished to step down from his role as Archon, and that faking his death was a test: if the Liyue Qixing 
            and Adepti could not stop Osial, he would have intervened. Zhongli informs the Traveler that their next destination, Inazuma, has closed off its borders under order of the Electro Archon, 
            Raiden Shogun.<br><br>
            
            Back in Mondstadt, the Traveler meets a mysterious individual named Dainsleif and together they investigate a plot by the Abyss Order to create an artificial god to topple Celestia. 
            Fighting one of the leaders of the Abyss, the Traveler's sibling suddenly intervenes, questioning why the Traveler is with Dainsleif. The sibling reveals that Dainsleif was a guard of 
            the fallen nation of Khaenri'ah, and has been cursed with immortality to see his countrymen turned into the Abyss Order. Remarking that the Traveler will come to understand the true 
            nature of the world at the end of their journey, the sibling departs, and Dainsleif chases after them. The Traveler attempts to follow but is unable to, and resolves to continue their 
            journey, setting their sights on Inazuma.<br><br>
