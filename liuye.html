          <p>
            <b class="bold">Ganyu</b><br>
            The secretary to the Liyue Qixing. The blood of both human and illuminated beast flows within her veins.
            Graceful and quiet by nature, yet the gentle disposition of qilin sees not even the slightest conflict with even the most arduous of workloads.
            After all, Ganyu firmly believes that all the work she does is in honor of her contract with Rex Lapis, seeking the well-being of all living things within Liyue.

          <p>
            <b class="bold">Hu Tao</b><br>
            Hu Tao is the 77th Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, a person vital to managing Liyue's funerary affairs.
            She does her utmost to flawlessly carry out a person's last rites and preserve the world's balance of yin and yang.
            Aside from this, she is also a talented poet whose many "masterpieces" have passed around Liyue's populace by word of mouth.

          <p>
            <b class="bold">Keqing</b><br>
            The Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing. Keqing has much to say about Rex Lapis' unilateral approach to policymaking in Liyue ⁠— but in truth, gods admire skeptics such as her quite a lot.
            She firmly believes that humanity's future should be determined by humans themselves, and that they can even do better than the archons and adepti have done for them. 
            In order to prove this, she works harder than anyone else.

          <p>
            <b class="bold">Qiqi</b><br>
            An apprentice and herb gatherer at Bubu Pharmacy. "Blessed" by the adepti with a body that cannot die, this petite zombie cannot do anything without first giving herself orders to do it. 
            Qiqi's memory is like a sieve. Out of necessity, she always carries around a notebook in which she writes anything important that she is sure to forget later. 
            But on her worst days, she even forgets to look at her notebook...

          <p>
            <b class="bold">Xiao</b><br>
            One of the "Mighty and Illuminated Adepti" guarding Liyue, also heralded as the "Guardian Yaksha."
            Despite his appearance as a young man, occasional legends about him have been documented in ancient books.
            He is especially fond of Wangshu Inn's Almond Tofu. The reason is that the dish tastes just like the "dreams" he used to devour.

          <p>
            <b class="bold">Zhongli</b><br>
            Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's mysterious consultant. Handsome, elegant, and surpassingly learned.
            Though no one knows where Zhongli is from, he is a master of courtesy and rules. 
            From his seat at Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, he performs all manner of rituals.
