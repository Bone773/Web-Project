        <b class="bold">Albedo</b><br>
        Albedo — an alchemist based in Mondstadt, in the service of the Knights of Favonius.
        "Genius," "Kreideprinz," or "Captain of the Investigation Team"... Such titles and honors are of no consequence to him when there is so much more research to conduct.
        The pursuit of fortune and connections cannot hold a candle to his heart's desire — acquiring the limitless, obscure knowledge left behind by previous generations of scholars.

        <b class="bold">Diluc</b><br>
        As the wealthiest gentleman in Mondstadt, the ever-dapper Diluc always presents himself as the epitome of perfection. 
        But behind the courteous visage burns a zealous soul that has sworn to protect Mondstadt at all costs, allowing him to mercilessly vanquish all who threaten his city.

        <b class="bold">Jean</b><br>
        As the Acting Grand Master of the Knights, Jean has always been devoted to her duties and maintaining peace in Mondstadt. 
        She had taken precautions long before the onset of Stormterror's assault, and she will guard Mondstadt with her life as always.

        Knights of Favonius Spark Knight! Forever with a bang and a flash! —And then disappearing from the stern gaze of Acting Grand Master Jean. 
        Sure, time in solitary confinement gives lots of time to think about new gunpowder formulas...
        But it'd still be better to not be in solitary in the first place.

        <b class="bold">Mona</b><br>
        A mysterious young astrologer who proclaims herself to be "Astrologist Mona Megistus," and who possesses abilities to match the title. 
        Erudite, but prideful. Though she is often strapped for cash and lives a life of thrift, she is resolved to never use astrology for profit... 
        It is this very resolution that has caused her to constantly fret about money.

      <p>        
        <b class="bold">Venti</b><br>
        A bard that seems to have arrived on some unknown wind - sometimes sings songs as old as the hills, and other times sings poems fresh and new. 
        Likes apples and lively places but is not a fan of cheese or anything sticky. 
        When using his Anemo power to control the wind, it often appears as feathers, as he's fond of that which appears light and breezy.
